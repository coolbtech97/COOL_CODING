1. Packing and Unpacking
len()   min()   max()   sum()   sorted()always returns as list
li = list( ItterableSequence)

li == l2
li < l2
li+=l2

New:::
Repetation Operator  *
    int * int = [ Multiply ]

    list * int = [ Repeation ]

    li = [1,2,3]* 4
    It means- [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3]

    li = [1,2,3]*2.5    Wrong ERROR
