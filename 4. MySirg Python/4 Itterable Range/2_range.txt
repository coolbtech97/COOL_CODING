RANGE
    range is a class
    range is immutable sequence               [immutable=Unchangeable]  [mutable=changeable]
    range can contain only ""int"" type values
    range contains sequence of integers with common difference (Arithmetic Progression)
                    (a+(n-1)d)

Create Range

    r= range(BEGIN ,END (not include) , STEPS)

    r= range( 1      ,   10    ,    2      )
            inclusive Exclusive Common diff

            {1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9}
    
    r= range( 2 , 8 , 2)

            {2 , 4 , 6}
    
    r= range( 10 , 3 , -2)

            {10 , 8 , 6 , 4}

ACCESS:
    for e in r:

NOTE:

    range(end)        beg=0   step=1
    if passes only 1 value,(it will considered as END, and beg=0,step=1)

    range(beg,end)            step=1
    if passes only 2 values,(it will considered as BEG,END, and step=1)

END value does not include in the range
