/* CSS SELECTORS
7. Descendant Selector              div p {}
8. Child Selector                   div > p
                            DIV and SECTION are "HIGHER BLOCK ELEMENTS"
                            property- Div,Section can not be a Child

                            and p, h1,h2.... are "block elements"
                          **block element cannot be a child,[except for HIGHER BLOCK ELEMENTS]

                          UL / OL child can ONLY be "LISTs" *li

                          **LIST could be the ""Main Branch"",
                            So, I can put DIV, SECTION and all block elements ALL.... in LIST***
