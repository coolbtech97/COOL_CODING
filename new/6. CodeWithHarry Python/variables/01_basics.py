# In python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program.
# A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assignment operator (=).

age = 34 # Integer
name = "Anand"  # String
cgpa = 4.55 # float

# Rule of Defining a variable in Python
# Variable name must start with a letter or an _
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscored.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age , Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names.

# 32age = 4 # Invalid because variable cannot start a number
age = 32 # Valid because variable can start with a number
# a&&ge = 45 # Invalid because varibales cannot contain special characters other than _
__age = 43
__nice__45 = 34
a_b_c_7 = "Cool"
