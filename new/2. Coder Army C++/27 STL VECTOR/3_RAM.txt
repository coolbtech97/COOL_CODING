RAM ( Random Access Memory )
It is divided into 2 Parts...

a. HEAP                                 b. STACK
Memory allocated Randomly               Memory Allocates Continuously
Large Proportion of RAM                 Small Proportion of RAM
can create large number of variables    create less number of variables
cannot create any variable in it easily All main() function variables gets memory here
vector gets memory in HEAP              int arr[],int a,etc.. gets merory in Statically
thats why vector<int>k(n),              int arr[n] WRONG ,int arr[1000] Need a constant value
vector can create "n" size of memory    static have limited memory, so if n=1cr,[OVERFLOW]

It is called```                         It is called```
Dynamically Memory Allocation           Statically Memory Allocation
{memory allocate at Run Time}           {Memory allocate at Compile Time}

                                        Stack is fast so, all simple variable allocates memory here
                                        at time of creation of C++
